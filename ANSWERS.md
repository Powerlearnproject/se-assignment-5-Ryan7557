2. First-time Setup:
When VSCode is installed. You can configure VSCode to your liking through it's various settings.
VSCode provides different scopes of settings:
- User settings - Settings that apply globally to any instance of VS Code you open.
- Workspace settings - Settings stored inside your workspace and only apply when the workspace is opened.

Themes:
Color themes enable you to modify the colors in the Visual Studio Code user interface to match your preferences and work environment. A Color Theme affects both the VS Code user interface elements and the editor highlighting colors.

Color Themes from the Marketplace:
There are several out-of-the-box color themes in VS Code for you to try. Many more themes have been uploaded to the VS Code Extension Marketplace by the community.

You can select Color Themes from the VS Code Marketplace directly from the Color Theme picker by selecting Browse Additional Color Themes....

Alternately, you can search for themes in the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X) search box by using the @category:"themes" filter.

Changes to settings are applied directly by VS Code, as you change them. Modified settings are indicated with a blue line, similar to modified lines in the editor.

In the example below, the Side Bar location and File Icon Theme were changed.

Installed VS Code extensions can also contribute their own settings, which you can review under the Extensions section of the Settings editor.
