2. First-time Setup:
When VSCode is installed. You can configure VSCode to your liking through it's various settings.
VSCode provides different scopes of settings:
- User settings - Settings that apply globally to any instance of VS Code you open.
- Workspace settings - Settings stored inside your workspace and only apply when the workspace is opened.

Themes:
Color themes enable you to modify the colors in the Visual Studio Code user interface to match your preferences and work environment. A Color Theme affects both the VS Code user interface elements and the editor highlighting colors.

Color Themes from the Marketplace:
There are several out-of-the-box color themes in VS Code for you to try. Many more themes have been uploaded to the VS Code Extension Marketplace by the community.

You can select Color Themes from the VS Code Marketplace directly from the Color Theme picker by selecting Browse Additional Color Themes....

The Project Manager is a useful extension for project managers to use to oversee several DevOps projects on VS Code at once. Regardless of where the projects are located, you can use the Project Manager extension to access them from a single computer. The Project Manager extension has more than 2.6 million downloads.



3. User Interface Overview:

![alt text](hero.png)

VS Code comes with a simple and intuitive layout that maximizes the space provided for the editor, while leaving ample room to browse and access the full context of your folder or project. The user interface is divided into five main areas:
    - Activity bar: Located on the far left-hand side. Lets you switch between views and gives you additional context-specific indicators, like the number of outgoing changes when Git is enabled. You can change the position of the Activity Bar.
    - Primary Side Bar - Contains different views like the Explorer to assist you while working on your project.
    - Editor - The main area to edit your files. You can open as many editors as you like side by side vertically and horizontally.
    - Status Bar - Information about the opened project and the files you edit.


4. Command Palette:
The command palette provides access to many commands. You can run editor commands, open files, search for symbols, and see a quick outline of a file, all using the same interactive windows.
The command palette can be accessed by a combination keys which are Ctrl+Shift+P, which brings up the Command palette.
Here are some examples that command palette can perform:
    - Running commands: Execute various commands, such as debugging, testing, and tasks.
    - Opening files and folders: Quickly open specific files, folders, or projects.
    - Editing configurations: Modify settings, such as user settings, workspace settings, and keyboard shortcuts.
